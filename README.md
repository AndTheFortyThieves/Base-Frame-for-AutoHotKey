When you want to publish an application written in AutoHotKey, you may want to have an installer and an update checker.
**This Base Frame has both of them!** :smile:

####Features:
- Installer
 - Add the files and scripts that will be packed into the installer
 - The intallers installs the application in a subfolder
 - It is able to make a new install or update the application
- Update Checker
 - Checks the online available version on every start of the application
 - If a new version is available and the user wishes, downloads the intstaller and startst the update process
- License terms
 - Automatically adds license terms
 - User needs to accept them on install

It's easy to use. After having set everything the first time all settings will be saved. Compiling and publishing a new version will take only about 1 minute!

It's available in English and German. Other translations can be made easily.
I am using it for AutoHotFlow and PABI Vokabeltrainer.

I think this base frame is very useful and may become better if following features will be included:
- Install in program files
- Provide an uninstaller
- Allow to choose the installation language by user
But those features are very hard to implement. I can't afford it. So it would be fine if you will help me to continue this project.

Alibaba already implemented many functions. I have translated the code into english now to allow you to become a contributor.
